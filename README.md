This repository contains the open-source code for the paper Evolutionary Hypergraph Learning: A Multi-Objective Influence Maximization Approach Considering Seed Selection Costs. The code implements algorithms for influence maximization on hypergraphs, optimizing both influence spread and seed selection cost.
